This document content some classification systems. We used two of the most datasets of machine learning MNIST and TITANIC datasets.

In these projects:
-  Binary classifier.
-  Performance Measures, Measuring Accuracy using Cross-Validation, get the Confusion Matrix, get the Precision and Recall then analyse the ROC Curve and the ROC AUC.
- Multiclass Classification.
- Error Analysis.
- Multilabel Classification.
